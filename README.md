[![bitHound Code](https://www.bithound.io/github/akmdelarosa/autorepairshop/badges/code.svg)](https://www.bithound.io/github/akmdelarosa/autorepairshop)&nbsp;[![GitHub version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/akmdelarosa%2Fautorepairshop.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/gh/akmdelarosa%2Fautorepairshop)
## THIS IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT MODE

This is a simple auto repair shop web application where users can schedule appointments, view service history information, and use the estimator tool to calculate the cost of a particular repair or maintenance service.

## Requirements
 [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is required.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll want to first clone this GitHub repository locally:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/akmdelarosa/autorepairshop.git
```

Next, you'll want to go into the autorepairshop app directory:

```bash
$ cd autorepairshop
```

Then you'll want to run `npm install` and `bower install` to download the dependencies and get
running!

Please read the full output of the `npm install` command -- it will explain how to run the project once
you've done so.

If you get stuck during the install process, you can restart it anytime.

That's it!
